Customer Churn Prediction 🧠📉
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior and demographics, businesses can proactively identify customers who are likely to stop using their services and take steps to retain them.

📁 Project Overview
Customer churn is a key metric in industries like telecommunications, banking, and SaaS. This notebook walks through:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data preprocessing

Model training using multiple classifiers

Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

📊 Features Used
Some features used in this project include:

Customer demographics (e.g., gender, age)

Service subscription details (e.g., internet service, phone service)

Account information (e.g., tenure, monthly charges, total charges)

🔍 Models Applied
The following models were implemented and compared:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

XGBoost

📈 Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

🛠️ Requirements
Install the following dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
You also need Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to run the .ipynb file:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install notebook
🧪 How to Run
Clone the repository or download the notebook.

Open it with Jupyter Notebook.

Run the notebook cell by cell to see the output and predictions.

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb
📌 Results
The best model (e.g., XGBoost or Random Forest) achieved a high accuracy and balanced precision/recall.

Insights from EDA helped identify key drivers of churn, such as tenure and service types.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used is assumed to be a cleaned version of the Telco Customer Churn dataset, often available on Kaggle.
