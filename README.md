# Customer Churn Prediction 🧠📉

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior and demographics, businesses can proactively identify customers who are likely to stop using their services and take steps to retain them.

## 📁 Project Overview

Customer churn is a key metric in industries like telecommunications, banking, and SaaS. This notebook walks through:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing
- Model training using multiple classifiers
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 📊 Features Used

Some features used in this project include:
- Customer demographics (e.g., gender, age)
- Service subscription details (e.g., internet service, phone service)
- Account information (e.g., tenure, monthly charges, total charges)

## 🔍 Models Applied

The following models were implemented and compared:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install the following dependencies:
    
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
